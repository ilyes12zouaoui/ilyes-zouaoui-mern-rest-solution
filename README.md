when we want to develope a mern stack project, using React,node,express,mongodb and a restful API, there is no starter project, so we have to
always redo the configuration and authentication and all the basic functionalities of a professional web application, that's why i decided to
create a starter project, configured with jwt authentication using passport, upload image using multer, and more.

update "configs/keys_dev.js" with your configs

enjoy :D
